This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

rm(list = ls())
setwd("E:/hyjiang/keepInMindR")

load(file="E:/hyjiang/keepInMindR/Min60_2016.RData")

df <- result$VCfactor
z1 <- droplevels(df[sample(100,10),])

as.POSIXct(as.character(z1$BuyTime), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
